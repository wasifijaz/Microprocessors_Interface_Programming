# Microprocessors and Interface Programming
## Objectives
PIC16F877a Programming using C, C++ and Assembly
### Lab 1
#### Introduction of Micro-C, Proteus and PIC16f877 Microcontroller
Task 1: Turn on each LED of PortD after one Second for one Second.

Task 2: A door sensor is connected to pin 1 of PortB, and LED is connected to pin 7 of PortD. Write a code for PIC in C which monitors the door and turns on LED when door is open.
### Lab 2
#### PIC16f877 Microcontroller Interrupts Programming
Task 1: Write a code that performs two operations OP1 and OP2. OP1 will run continuously while OP2 will run only when external interrupt will appear.

OP1: PD7, PD6, PD5 will blink simultaneously after every second

OP2: PD4, PD3, PD2 will roll once and move back to OP1

Task 2: Using RB port change perform the following operations.

OP1: Blink the LEDs attached to port D (RD0 – RD3) continuously.

OP2: LEDs attached to port D pins RD4 – RD7 should only turn on in such a manner as to display which bit of RB port change has changed its state.
