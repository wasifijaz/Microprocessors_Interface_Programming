# Microprocessors and Interface Programming
## Objectives
Microprocessor and Microcontroller PIC16F877a Programming using C, C++ and Assembly
### Lab 1
#### Introduction of Micro-C, Proteus and PIC16f877 Microcontroller
#### Task 1: 
Turn on each LED of PortD after one Second for one Second.
#### Task 2: 
A door sensor is connected to pin 1 of PortB, and LED is connected to pin 7 of PortD. Write a code for PIC in C which monitors the door and turns on LED when door is open.
### Lab 2
#### PIC16f877 Microcontroller Interrupts Programming
#### Task 1: 
Write a code that performs two operations OP1 and OP2. OP1 will run continuously while OP2 will run only when external interrupt will appear.

OP1: PD7, PD6, PD5 will blink simultaneously after every second

OP2: PD4, PD3, PD2 will roll once and move back to OP1
#### Task 2: 
Using RB port change perform the following operations.

OP1: Blink the LEDs attached to port D (RD0 – RD3) continuously.

OP2: LEDs attached to port D pins RD4 – RD7 should only turn on in such a manner as to display which bit of RB port change has changed its state. 
### Lab 3
#### Seven Segment Display using 16F877 Microcontroller
#### Task 1:
Take last four(4) digits of your roll number and display them on Seven Segment.
### Lab 4
#### 2-Dimensional Key-Pad interface using PIC16F877 Microcontroller
#### Task 1
2-Dimensional Key-Pad interface using PIC16F877 Microcontroller
### Lab 5
#### LCD interfacing with PIC16F877A
#### Task 1
Display your name and roll number on the lcd
### Lab 6
#### Introduction to Assembly Language and Addressing modes of 8086/8088 processor
#### Task 1
Write an assembly code to read and write “1234h” in DS. Using addressing modes mentioned below
* Direct addressing mode
* Register indirect addressing mode
* Indexed addressing mode
* Based indexed plus displacement addressing mode
### Lab 7
#### 8086/8088 Arithmetic Instructions
#### Task 1
Calculate the following expression in the emulator

[(a*b)+(c*d)]/e

For a=5, b=2, c=2, d=2 and e=7
#### Task 2
Calculate the same expression as mentioned in task 1 but this time take values from the user and display the result on the emulator screen.
### Lab 9
#### 8086 Logical Instructions
#### Task 1
Multiply decimal 14 with decimal 14 using Add and Shift operators.
### Lab 10
#### 8086/8088 Program Flow Control
#### Task 1
Take a 16-but integer from the user and find out whether a number is even or odd and display on the screen.
### Lab 11
#### 8086/8088 Program Flow Control II
#### Task 1
Initialize an array with 10 elements and calculate its average using loop instruction. Make a seperate subroutine that must be called from main function and display the result on screen.
### Lab 12
#### 8086 Logic Instructions Flow
#### Task 1
Take marks of subject as an input from the user and display the grade on screen.
#### Task 2
Compare the contents of two arrays and display whether arrays are equal or not. Use subroutine to write the comparison.
#### Task 3
Calculate the dot product of two arrays using loop instruction.
#### Task 4
Using loops read a string, character by character from the user and display it on screen similarly.
### Lab 13
#### Timer Lab
#### Task 1
Write a program that uses Timer1 to generate a square wave on PORTD.5, while at the same time transfers data from PORTC to PORTB.
#### Task 2
Assume that clock pulses are fed into the TICK1 pin and an alram led is connected on PORTB.0. Write a program for counter 1 to power up the alarm led after every 100 pulses.
